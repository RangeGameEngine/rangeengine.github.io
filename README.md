# Instructions
* Open `Run_Localhost.cmd` in a text-editor and set both `PATH` & `PY_SCRIPT` variables to fit your local structure.
* Run `Run_Localhost.cmd` by double-clicking it.
* Go to your browser and enter `localhost` as your URL address.
  * If this doesn't work try `localhost:80` instead - `80` stands for port 80, which is the default port on most computers.
    * If the port is already being used by some other service, open `Run_Localhost.py` and modify the `PORT` variable to state a different port.
