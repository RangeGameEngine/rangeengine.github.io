Range Manual
============

Welcome to Range's Documentation! Here you will 
find definitions of the available tools and features in Range Game Engine, step-by-step 
tutorials to certain tasks and the Python API for game logic programming 
with detailed information (and examples in some cases).

Note: this api is from UPBGE and is still being adapted.
