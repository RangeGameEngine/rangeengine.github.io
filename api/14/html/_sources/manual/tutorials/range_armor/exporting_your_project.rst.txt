In this example the project will be exported to Windows x64, so you need to copy some Range Engine
Windows x64 files to the **Engine/Windows64** folder

.. figure:: /manual/tutorials/range_armor/img/enginefiles.png

.. warning::

   If you want to export to Windows/Linux x86/x64 you got to have 
   this Range Engine releases downloaded

Icons Folder

In this folder you can set custom icons to your project executable file, you just got to replace
the stardard icons in the folder for your custom icons with the same name as the default icons
