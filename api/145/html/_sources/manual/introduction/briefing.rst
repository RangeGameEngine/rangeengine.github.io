History
-------

RanGE is a light and powerfull game engine and 
its aim is to clean up and improve current **Uchronia Project Blender Game Engine 0.2.5b (UPBGE)** code, experiment with new features, and 
implement forgotten features that have not been merged with the UPBGE trunk.

Features
--------

Range have lots of `new features <https://github.com/RangeGameEngine/Range-Engine-Wiki/wiki/Release-notes>`__, 
improvements and bugs fixed that UPBGE haven't. Some features that Range supports are:

- Realtime advanced physics powered by `Bullet <https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3>`__, including rigid bodies, soft bodies, obstacle simulation and path finding.
- Fully integrated audio engine powered by `OpenAL <https://www.openal.org/>`__ and `SDL <https://www.libsdl.org/>`__, supporting 3D sound and sound effects.
- Easy and straightforward visual logic system.
- Powerful `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ language bindings, allowing support to even more libraries through the use of `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`__.
- Development process entirely inside Blender, without needing to import/export assets.
- Execution of game in Blender's viewport (for fast previewing) or on an standalone executable.
- Blender's `Linked Libraries <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/linked_libraries.html>`__ feature, allowing to organize projects in multiple blend files.
- OpenGL custom shaders for visual effects and post processing.
- Fake or realtime reflections setting directly through the interface.

Development
-----------

Development is being supported by the community, support the project on patreon.
