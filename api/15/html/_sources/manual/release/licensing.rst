files and launch them separated from the blenderplayer executable, this exporter do not
bundle any RanGE components so you have all the rights of your game.

In summary, the software and source code of Range Engine are bound to the GNU GPL,
but the Range Armor and .range/.rasec files (models, textures, sounds) are not.
