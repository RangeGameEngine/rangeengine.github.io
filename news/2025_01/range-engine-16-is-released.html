                    <p>After almost a year of hard work we are proud to announce the long-awaited launch of the Range Engine 1.6 LTS. This version has faced numerous challenges and setbacks during its development. 
                        Despite these difficulties, our dedicated team has worked tirelessly to bring this version to life.<br>
                        Today we proudly present the result of all this work we've been doing for so long.
                    </p> <!-- News Text -->
                    <h2>The development:</h2> <!-- Topic Title -->
                    <p>Range Engine 1.6 began with the intention of implementing small features and incremental improvements. 
                        However, the lack of proper planning and the absence of a clear roadmap led to a series of challenges for the development team.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As the project progressed, new features and improvements were added without a clear vision of priorities. 
                        This resulted in a backlog of tasks and an overload for us developers, who began to feel the effects of burnout.</p>
